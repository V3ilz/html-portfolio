<h1>The Best Movies According to William</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>This movie made me feel better about myself knowing that other people already<br>
experienced psychosis as well; it was when I didn't really knew what it was all<br>
about at the time.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>I really liked the depth in this movie, a dream within a dream is an enjoyable<br>
metaphor for life itself.</p>
<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>From this point forward, I developed a special relationship with the matter of<br>
psychology; through the represented relationship between Will and his therapist.</p>
